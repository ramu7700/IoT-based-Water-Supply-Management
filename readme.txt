Project Overview: Water Supply Management Dashboard

The Water Supply Management Dashboard is a web-based application designed to monitor and manage water resources effectively. This dashboard provides real-time data visualization for key metrics, including:

- Water Flow: Measures the amount of water flowing through various reservoirs.
- Pressure: Monitors the pressure levels in the water supply system.
- Water Quality: Assesses the pH levels of the water.
- Consumption: Tracks water usage over time.

Key Features
- Real-Time Monitoring: Users can view live data from multiple reservoirs, ensuring they have up-to-date information.
- Predictive Analytics: The system forecasts future water demand based on historical data and seasonal trends, enabling better resource allocation and maintenance scheduling.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Bootstrap, the dashboard is responsive and easy to navigate on different devices.
- Dynamic Data Fetching: AJAX is used to retrieve data from a MySQL database without refreshing the page.

Arduino Code Overview

The Arduino code plays a vital role in collecting data from various sensors installed in the water supply system. Here’s what you have implemented:

Key Components of the Arduino Code

1. Sensor Initialization:
   - The code initializes sensors for measuring water flow, pressure, and pH levels, connecting them to specific GPIO pins on the Arduino.

2. Data Collection:
   - It reads sensor data at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 minutes), calculating flow rates and converting analog readings from pressure and pH sensors into usable values.

3. Data Formatting:
   - Collected data is formatted into a JSON payload that includes flow rate, pressure, pH level, and consumption metrics.

4. Data Transmission:
   - The Arduino establishes a Wi-Fi connection using provided credentials and sends the JSON payload to a PHP script hosted on a local server (XAMPP) via HTTP POST requests.

5. Error Handling:
   - The code includes mechanisms to handle errors during data transmission, ensuring reliable operation.

 Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simplified example of your Arduino code:

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <HTTPClient.h>

const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";
const char* serverUrl = "http://localhost/fetch_data.php";

void setup() {
    // Initialize sensors and Wi-Fi connection
}

void loop() {
    // Read sensor values
    float flowRate = readFlowSensor();
    float pressure = readPressureSensor();
    float pH = readPHsensor();

    // Prepare JSON payload
    String payload = "{\"flowRate\":" + String(flowRate) +
                     ",\"pressure\":" + String(pressure) +
                     ",\"pH\":" + String(pH) + "}";

    // Send data to server
    if (WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED) {
        HTTPClient http;
        http.begin(serverUrl);
        http.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
        int httpResponseCode = http.POST(payload);
        http.end();
    }

    delay(600000); // Wait for 10 minutes
}
```

Summary of Accomplishments

1.Set Up Environment: Installed XAMPP for local server management.
2.Created Database: Established a MySQL database (`water_supply_db`) with a table (`reservoir_data`) to store sensor data.
3.Developed Dashboard: Built a web-based dashboard using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript (Chart.js) for visualization.
4.Implemented Arduino Code: Developed Arduino code to collect sensor data and send it to the server.

This project effectively integrates hardware and software components to create a comprehensive solution for managing water resources.
